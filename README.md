Pixel Patterns is a project aimed at developers that simplifies the integration of CSS and Tailwind components into their projects. The application allows you to copy ready-to-use components with just one click, making styling and building interfaces quick and efficient.

This open-source project not only offers an initial library of components but also allows the community to contribute their own components. With an intuitive interface and constantly expanding features, Pixel Patterns is ideal for those looking for a practical way to enhance front-end development.

**Goals**:
  - Facilitate the use of CSS and Tailwind components with a one-click copy feature
  - Allow the community to contribute their own components
  - Continuous expansion with new features and components

* If you like the project, give it a star ⭐ and share to help out.
